<ins>Step 1:</ins> Set up a free Google Earth Engine (GEE) account as described [here](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/gee-sign-up.html).

<ins>Step 2a:</ins> Use the following javaScript (JS) code to produce Maha rice maps for the year(s) of interest.  The result will be a rice map at 30-meter pixels where pixel value = 1 means rice presence in the Maha season for that year:

The resulting rice map images for 15 years [2010-2024] for the Maha season can be found here as a [GEE imageCollection asset](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?asset=projects/ee-ozdogan05/assets/srilanka/LK_maha_rice_v3). This is provided for convenience to the user.

<ins>Step 2a:</ins> Use the following javaScript (JS) code to produce Yala rice maps for the year(s) of interest. The result will be a rice map at 30-meter pixels where pixel value = 1 means rice presence in the Yala season for that year:
